# Credit Card Customer Segmentation using Clustering üí≥

## Project Description üìå: 
Synthesize a sample dataset comprising a recent 6-month usage behavior of approximately 9000 active credit card holders. The dataset is structured at the customer level and encompasses 18 behavioral variables.

## Objective: 
Utilize cluster analysis to segment credit card customers for effective marketing strategies.

## Project Overview üìñ: 
1. **Data Import** & **Understanding**
   - Insights: Initial glimpse into the dataset, understanding the structure and the type of data we're dealing with.

2. **Data Preprocessing** & **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 
   - **Missing Values & Feature Drop**: Tackling the challenges of incomplete data and irrelevant features to streamline our analysis.
   - **EDA Techniques**:
     - Histograms: Visualizing distributions of numerical variables.
     - Boxplot: Identifying outliers and the spread of the data.
     - Heatmap: Unveiling correlations between variables.

3. **Feature Engineering** 
   - Addressing right-skewed data with 'Square root transformation' to normalize distributions and improve model performance.

4. **Pre-Modeling** 
   - Scaling: Standardizing the range of our features for optimal clustering.
   - PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reducing dimensionality while retaining the essence of our data.

5. **Model Building** 
   - **KMeans Clustering**: Segmenting our customers into meaningful groups based on their behavior and attributes.

6. **Cluster Interpretation** 
   - Diving deep into each cluster to understand the defining characteristics and behaviors of segmented customer groups.
